"""Generate status.json — public system health surface for the signal stack.

Queries the live Signal Intelligence API, runs the same circuit breaker
checks as the watchdog, and writes a structured status.json that external
builders can read to determine whether the stack is safe to integrate against.

Usage:
    export PF_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
    python3 generate_status.py

    # or specify output path
    python3 generate_status.py --out /path/to/status.json

The output file is designed to be committed to the public repo so it is
accessible at:
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sendoeth/post-fiat-signals/main/status.json

Health states:
    HEALTHY   — all subsystems operational, signals fresh, safe to integrate
    DEGRADED  — warning conditions present, proceed with caution
    HALT      — signal integrity compromised, do not rely on signals

Each component reports its own state and a human-readable message explaining
the current condition in terms a first-time builder would understand.
